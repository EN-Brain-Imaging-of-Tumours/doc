# There are a list of things we would like to see happening

## repository wise
- use credentials across multiple databases / repository https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201839 ; check with datalad
- use browser for BIDS @danlurie https://github.com/danlurie/bdpdb
- mint DOI for each dataset https://kaptur.wordpress.com/2012/05/28/minting-dois-for-research-data-in-the-uk/

## data-protocol wise
- [standard data quality for different 'sequences' (MRI but also MEEG)](https://github.com/EN-Brain-Imaging-of-Tumours/doc/wiki/Minimal-and-extended-imaging-protocol)  
- BIDS [extension dictionary](https://github.com/EN-Brain-Imaging-of-Tumours/doc/wiki/BIDS-dictionary-extension)

## analysis wise
- comparison of procedures 'clinically' relevant (typically subject wise different from group analyses)
